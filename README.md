## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of the workshop is to use mBots to teach basic coding and debugging. This workshop has participants dissect incorrect code snippets and debug the code to perform the correct action. The students will be split up into three groups tackling the following topics: RGB Lights, Speed & Distance, and Turns/Lateral Movements. From there, students will regroup and be split into six teams to collaborate on completing a track in the fastest time.

<!-- 
Your Options for target audience: 
  - High School
  - College
  - Middle School
  - K-12
  - Non-Stem
  - Undergraduate
You can select from a range of audiences or a single auidience. Examples: 
    Middle School - College 
    High School - College
    K-12
  You will be presenting most often to your peers who are taking introductory technology classes, so more often than not you should be including college in your target audience range. 
-->
* <b>Difficulty Level:</b> beginner
* <b>Target Audience:</b> middle school, college
* <b>Duration of Workshop:</b> TBD
* <b>Needed Materials:</b> tablets, mBot Mega, mBlock, cardboard maze, 
* <b>Learning Outcomes:</b> The desired outcome is to get students familiar with basic coding and debugging.
* <b>Your Main Technology</b> mBot Mega - a remote-controlled robot car that can move in all directions with its mecanum wheels and app remote control.
* [Technology Ambassador Program](https://tapggc.org/) <b>(TAP)</b> is a project-based class that provides a collaborative environment for students to work with their fellow classmates on a semester-long project using technologies of their choice. TAP strives to increase participation in IT through numerous outreach activities and workshops that are designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
Students will first observe a demo of how the code is intended to make the mBot react. They will then receive "broken code" and learn how to analyze and interpret block-based code to identify and fix errors. Through guided instruction, students will develop problem-solving skills as they work to debug the provided code snippets, ultimately getting the mBot to perform actions similar to the demo. Once the concepts are taught students will need to create their own code to complete a track.

* [mBot](https://www.makeblock.com/pages/mbot-robot-kit/)  is an educational robot kit designed to help beginners learn programming, robotics, and electronics through hands-on activities.
* It works by allowing users to program its behavior and movements using block-based coding in mBlock software or advanced programming languages like Arduino C, enabling it to perform tasks such as obstacle avoidance, line-following, and remote control.
* As a team, we chose mBot as our technology for our project as we believe it is very interactive in teaching people how to code and letting them see how their code controls the mBot's movements.
